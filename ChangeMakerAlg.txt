Inputs:     price of item and cash tendered
Outputs:    change in dollars, change in pennies, and how many of
            each bill or coin is needed to give the correct change.


The program requires the user to input the price of an item and the cash tendered.
Prompts will be needed to ask the user to do this.

This program will need to:
    caluculate the change of this transaction in dollars
    calculate what this change is in pennies
    list how many of each bill or coin is needed to give the correct change

STEPS:
    1)  have the string "price" be equal to the price of the item the user inputs
    2)  convert this price to a floating point number
    3)  mulitply this number by 100 to get the number into pennies for arithmetic
    4)  convert this floating point number to an integer
            the string "price" will now equal the price of the item the user inputs as an integer in pennies

    5)  have the string "paid" be equal to the cash tendered the user inputs
    6)  convert this price to a floating point number
    7)  mulitply this number by 100 to get the number into pennies for arithmetic
    8)  convert this floating point number to an integer
            the string "paid" will now equal the cash tendered the user inputs as an integer in pennies

    9)  have the string "dollars" equal the difference between cash tendered and price of the item
    10) divide dollars by 100 to get the number in pennies
    11) have the string "change" equal the difference between cash tendered and price of the item

    12) displays the change in dollars and the change in pennies to the user

    13) divde the change in pennies by 2000 with no remainder and display this
        number to the user to get the amount of twenties needed for change
    14) use modulus operator, %, to get the remainder
    15) use this remainder to do the rest of the arithmetic
        (for tens, fives, ones, quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies)
    16) every bill and coin should be displayed to the user to give the correct change
